             - State and Execution Modules
             - test.ping

           - h2: Execution Modules
           - p: 'Execution modules are used when calling modules directly from the command line.'
           - code: |
               salt '*' user.add fred uid gid groups home shell
           - class_notes: |
               1. Speak to how basic targeting is done, with just * for now.
               2. Talk about how Modules perform all the work for salt.
               3. Show how you would use a module via the command line.

         -
           - h2: test.ping
           - p: This is the most basic module you can run. It simply connects to the targeted minion(s) and returns True if that minion responds.
           - code: |
               salt '*' test.ping
               minion1:
                   True
               minion2:
                   True
           - p: There is no matching state module for test.ping.

         -
           - h2: test.ping Demo
           - class_notes: |
               SSH to your salt master, and run the command "salt '*' test.ping" and show the output to the class.

         -
           - h2: Running Commands
           - p: Running arbitrary commands can come in handy for one time operations. This is done with the cmd.run module.
           - p: Execution Example
           - code: |
               salt webservers cmd.run "service apache2 restart"
           - p: State Example
           - code: |
               touch /tmp/foo:
                 cmd.run:
                   - creates: /tmp/foo
           - class_notes: |
               Make sure you make the point that one of commands shouldn't be run over and over unless they are idempotent. Idempotent is the idea that a state file or command can be run over and over, and it checks to make sure it needs to perform an action before attempting to do so.

         -
           - h2: Date Command Demo
           - class_notes: |
               SSH to your salt master, and run the command "salt '*' cmd.run date" and show the output to the class. This should output the result of the date command as run on each minion.

         -
           - h2: Your turn!
           - ul:
             - on your salt master run the test.ping module targeting all minions
             - Look up the documentation on the user module
           - link: 'http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.useradd.html'
           - code: |
               salt --doc
           - class_notes: |
               1. Semi guided lab. There may be many who need help at first. Guide them through running the test.ping command and looking up documentation on a module.

           - h2: State Modules
           - p: 'State modules are used when calling state.sls or highstate against a minion.'
           - code: |
               salt '*' state.sls myslsfile
           - code: |
               fred:
                 user.present:
                   - fullname: Fred Jones
                   - shell: /bin/zsh
                   - home: /home/fred
                   - uid: 4000
                   - gid: 4000
                   - groups:
                     - wheel
                     - storage
                     - games
           - class_notes: |
               1. Talk to the ability to write state files that make use of modules.
               2. State files are written in yaml
               3. Mention basic structure but point out how similar it is to running the same command earlier on command line.

           - h2: Installing a Package
           - p: Package installations are abstracted by Salt. You don't have to invoke a specific yum or apt module, but a pkg module.
           - p: Execution Example
           - code: |
               salt '*' pkg.install vim
           - p: State Example
           - code: |
               vim:
                 pkg.installed
           - p: Package names can still be different between distributions. (ie. apache2 and httpd)

         -
           - h2: Installing sysstat Demo
           - class_notes: |
               SSH to your salt master, and run the command "salt '*' pkg.install sysstat" and show the output to the class. This should install the sysstat package on the targeted minions, and show the old/new package versions.

         -
           - h2: Starting a Service
           - p: Starting services is done with the service module.
           - p: Execution Example
           - code: |
               salt '*' service.start apache2
           - p: State Example
           - code: |
               apache2:
                 service:
                   - running
           - p: Service names can still be different between distributions. (ie. apache2 and httpd)

         -
           - h2: Restart SSH Demo
           - class_notes: |
               SSH to your salt master, and run the command "salt '*' service.restart ssh" and show the output to the class. This should restart the ssh service and show True if successful.

         -
           - h2: Your turn!
           - ul:
             - Write a state.sls file that will install the nginx webserver
             - execute that state file from the command line using the state.sls module
           - p: hint
           - code: |
               vim:
                 pkg.installed
           - class_notes: |
               1. Have the students attempt to write a file that contains a state to install nginx

           - h2: Grains
           - p: A grain is a piece of data related directly to a Salt Minion. You can view all grains related to a node with the grains.items module.
           - code: |
               salt minion1 grains.items
           - p: You can target minions using data in grains. This example will target all your CentOS servers with a test.ping.
           - code: |
               salt -G 'os:CentOS' test.ping

         -
           - h2: Grains Demo
           - class_notes: |
               SSH to your salt master, and run the command "salt '*' grains.items" and show the class all the various data collected in grains.

         -
           - h2: Lab
           - p: Find an execution or state module in SaltStack's Documentation and share it with the class.
           - link: [ 'http://docs.saltstack.org', 'http://docs.saltstack.org' ]
