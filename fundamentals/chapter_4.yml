             - Highly extendable

           - h2: 'Download salt-bootstrap'
           - code: |
              wget -O install_salt.sh https://bootstrap.saltstack.com
           - class_notes: |
              Downloading salt-bootstrap is pretty to the point.

         -
           - h2: 'Run salt-bootstrap'
           - code: |
              sh install_salt.sh
           - p: 'This example installs the minion'
           - p: 'Use -h to show the help'
           - class_notes: |
               The goal is to get them to read the help notes on the script.<br/>

           - h2: 'Example flags'
           - code: |
              sh install_salt.sh -M -A localhost
           - p: 'This will install the Master and Minion (and configure it) all on the same machine.'
           - class_notes: |
               The -M installs the Master<br/>
               The -A localhost configures the minion to talk to the master on the same box

         -
           - h2: 'Salt Keys'
           - p: 'Salt Keys manages which machines are allowed / not allowed to commicate with the Salt Master'
           - code: |
              salt-key
           - p: 'The -A flag will accept all pending keys'
           - class_notes: |
               Don't use -A. Accept single keys per hostname.
               Use -L to list all keys.

           - h2: 'Verify installation'
           - code: |
              salt-master --versions-report

               Don't worry if your versions are not the same.  That is ok.
