           - h2: 'Download salt-bootstrap'
           - code: |
              wget -O salt_install.sh http://bootstrap.saltstack.org
           - class_notes: |
              Downloading salt-bootstrap is pretty to the point.

           - h2: 'Run salt-bootstrap'
           - code: |
              sh salt_install.sh
           - p: 'This example will install the minion, but -h will list all the flags'
           - class_notes: |
               The goal is to get them to read the help notes on the script.<br/>

           - code: |
              sh install_salt.sh -M -A localhost
           - p: 'This will install the Master and Minion (and configure it) all on the same machine.'
           - class_notes: |
               The -M installs the Master<br/>
               The -A localhost configures the minion to talk to the master on the same box

           - p: 'Salt Keys manages which machines are allowed / not allowed to commicate with the Salt Master'
           - code: |
              salt-key
           - p: 'The -A flag will accept all pending keys'
