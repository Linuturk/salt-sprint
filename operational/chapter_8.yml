           - h1: Fleur De Sel
           - p: Really fancy salt
           - ul: 
             - Salt Cloud
             - Salt Mine
             - Reactor
             - Syndic
             - Returners and Runners

         -
           - h2: Salt Cloud
           - p: Spins up servers on the cloud, automatically installing the Salt Minion and approving the minions key
           - p: Works with popular cloud APIs
           - ul:
             - Openstack (ie. Rackspace Cloud Server)
             - Parallels
             - Softlayer
             - Amazon

         -
           - h2: Salt Mine
           - p: Runs arbitrary salt execution functions at a specified interval
           - ul:
             - Provides results to all minions
             - Useful for integrating live data in state runs and executions
           - class_notes: |
                   Load balancer nodes
                   firewall IP ranges
                   data in mine can be stale!
                   publish.publish is another option

         -
           - h2: Reactor
           - p: Provides a system where commands can be executed in response to events within the infrastructure
           - p: '<br/>'
           - p: Examples of types of events
           - ul:
             - Minion added to instracture
             - Highstate ran
             - Cloud-based server removed

         -
           - h2: Syndic
           - p: Like a master of masters, it allows you to create a hierarchal structure of control for large or sprawling infrastructure
           - ul:
             - Good for infrastructures with thousands of nodes
             - Good for infrastructures that span multiple regions or datacenters

         -
           - h2: Salt Returners
           - p: Stores the results of Salt jobs in an external backend
           - ul:
             - Redis
             - MongoDB
             - Postgres
             - SMTP

         -
           - h2: Salt Runners
           - p: Like execution modules but run on the master, interacting with minions using the salt client
           - ul:
             - Handy for scripting large scale events
             - Written in python, structurally similar to other modules
             - Ran via <b>salt-run</b>
             - Usually run against the entire environment
