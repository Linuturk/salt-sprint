           - h2: What's in a Salt State
           - p: A salt state consists of identifiers, state module and function declarations, and sometimes function parameters
           - ul:
             - Identifiers name the resources to operate on
             - State modules bundle functionality to manage a type of resource
             - State functions are used to define the desired state of the resource
             - Function parameters provide specific details for the state function

         -
           - h2: Basic Salt State
           - p: A state file to ensure mysql-server is installed
           - h6: /srv/salt/mysql.sls

               mysql-server:    # Identifier
                 pkg:           # State module
                   - installed  # State function
           - p: You may also supply the State module and function on a single line
           - code: |
               mysql-server:     # Identifier
                  pkg.installed  # State module and function on the same line

         -
           - h2: Salt State with function parameters

           - code: |
               /tmp/test:           # Identifier
                 file.directory:    # State module and function
                   - user: root     # State function parameter
                   - dir_mode: 644  # Another parameter

           - h2: Organizing Salt States
           - p: State files may be organized in folders
           - p: Our <b>/srv/salt/mysql.sls</b> could be moved to <b>/srv/salt/mysql/init.sls</b> and used in the same manner
           - code: |
               salt '*' state.sls mysql
           - p: If we've put an additional state in <b>/srv/salt/mysql/service.sls</b> it can be ran as <b>mysql.service</b>
           - code: |
               salt '*' state.sls mysql.service
