  title: Salt Operational, Chapter 5, Ordering Execution
  description: Through the use of salt requisites students will learn how to make sure certain things happen in a specific order as well as react to changes. EX. make sure packages are installed before starting a service. Restart a service after a config change.

               2. Understand pillars and its uses.
               3. Targeting based on pillar variables and grains in states and command line.

                 pkg.installed:
                   - name: mysql

               mysql_config:

           - class_notes: |
               1. The require statement is used to load one action before another action.
               2. States are ordered natively. If an installed package failed, a required state won't run.

                 pkg.installed:
                   - name: mysql
                   - require_in:
                     - file: mysql_config

               1. The require_in is the literal reverse of require.
               2. Example above is the same as the previous example but using require_in.

           - ul:
             - In your install apache state create a new state to ensure that apache is running
             - Make sure that the service.running state is ran after the install of apache

               install_apache:
                 pkg.installed:
                   - name: apache2

               start_apache:
                 service.running:
                   - name: apache2
                   - require:
                     - pkg: install_apache

           - h2: Watch
           - p: 'Statement used to monitor changes in other states'
           - code: |
               mysql_service_restart:
                 service.restart:
                   - name: mysqld
                   - watch:
                     - file: mysql_config
           - class_notes: |
               1. Watch only applies when a high state is run.
               2. Does not watch for user modifications to file but only if salt itself modifies it.
               3. In this example we have a mysql restart action that watches and triggers on the mysql_config action from the previous example.

           - h2: Prereq
           - p: 'Allows for actions to be taken based on the expected results of a state that has not yet been executed'
           - code: |
               apache_stop:
                 cmd.run:
                   - name: service apache stop
                   - prereq:
                     - file: site_code

               apache_start:
                 cmd.run:
                   - name: service apache start
                   - watch:
                     - file: site_code

               site_code:
                 file.recurse:
                   - name: /opt/site_code
                   - source: salt://site/code
           - class_notes: |
               1. In this example we show how repreq can work in conjunction with watch to have Apache shutdown before site_code executes.
               2. Then, apache_start will run based on its watching of site_code being actioned.

           - h2: "Lab: Prereq"
           - ul:
             - In your states, have a state that will run the echo command before apache will be installed
             - Create another state that will run a different echo command after apache gets installed
           - class_notes: |
               1. just have them play with prereq and watch

           - h2: Cliff Notes
           - code: |
               pre_echo_apache:

               post_echo_apache:
                 cmd.run:
                   - name: "echo 'apache has been installed'"
                   - watch:
                     - pkg: install_apache

               include:
                 - foo

               bar_install:

                   - require:
                     - sls: foo
           - class_notes: |
               1. Here we are including the sls file 'foo' and in the 'bar' action we require the sls 'foo'.

         -
           - h2: "Lab: Include"
           - p: 'Split our your big state file in to seperate directories with a init.sls file in it and include them in a single state'
           - ul:
             - Create seperate sls files for each of your states
             - Remove your state from the init.sls file and replace them with includes for the files you created
           - class_notes: |
               1. Student should be told that this is considered best practice, to have the init just include state files.
               2. State files can have more than one state in them

                 - install_apache
                 - create_users
           - class_notes: |
               1. they can name there fils whatever they want. as long as they make sense

           - h2: Order
           - code: |
               mysql_install:
                 pkg.installed:
                   - name: mysql-server
                   - order: 1
           - class_notes: |
               1. Not a best practice and require should be used before this.
               2. 'last' is also an option for order along with numeric values.
