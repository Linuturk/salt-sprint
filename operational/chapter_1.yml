         -
           - h2: Overstate
           - p: A system by which a Master can issue function calls to minions in a deterministic order

         -
           - h2: Pillar
           - p: A simple key-value store for user-defined data to be made available to a minion. Often used to store and distribute sensitive data to minions

         -
           - h2: Proxy Minion
           - p: A minion which can control devices that are unable to run a Salt minion locally, such as routers and switches
         -
           - h2: Reactor
           - p: An interface for listening to events and defining actions that Salt should taken upon receipt of given events

         -
           - h2: State Module
           - p: A module which contains a set of state functions

         -
           - h2: State Function
           - p: A function contained inside a state module which can manages the application of a particular state to a system. State functions frequently call out to one or more execution modules to perform a given task.
