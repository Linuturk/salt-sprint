           - h2: Setting permissions
           - code: |
               enforce_permissions:
                 file.directory:
                   - name: /srv/pillar/
                   - user: thatch

           - code: |
                enforce_permissions:
                 file.directory:
                   - name: /var/www/html
                   - user: www-data
                   - group: www-data
                   - dir_mode: 755
                   - file_mode: 644
                   - makedirs: True
                   - recurse:
                     - user

                     - mode
           - class_notes: |
               1. Recurse enforces these permissions to all files and sub-directories.
               2. Note the dir_mode and file_mode settings versus the plain mode.

           - h2: Extract an archive
           - code: |
                extract_tar:
                 archive.extracted:
                   - name: /usr/local/bin
                   - source: salt://myscripts.zip
                   - archive_format: tar
                   - user: root
                   - group: root
           - class_notes: |

           - h2: cliff notes
           - code: |
               extract_wordpress:
                 archive.extracted:
                   - name: /var/www/html/
                   - source: https://wordpress.org/latest.zip
                   - source_hash: md5=cd9c13c1021318c61a2606fea1f2779a
                   - archive_format: zip
                   - user: www-data
                   - group: www-data
                   - if_missing: /var/www/html/wordpress
           - class_notes: |
               1. Explain why the source_hash is important. It ensures the download was completed successfully.
               It also ensures you are downloading the file you expect.
               2. Explain how if_missing makes this state idempotent. It won't run again if that folder exists.
