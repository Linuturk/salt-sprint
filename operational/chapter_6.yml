           - class_notes: |
               1. Understand grains and its uses.
               2. Understand pillars and its uses.
               3. Targeting based on pillar variables and grains in states and command line.

           - h2: Grains
           - p: 'Information about the system the minion is running on or custom grains'
           - ul:
             - Static info from minion start
             - Custom grains
             - /etc/salt/grains
           - class_notes: |
               1. Grains give infomation about the underlying system the minion is running on. 
               2. Custom grains can be set via command line or in /etc/salt/grains.

           - h2: Command Line Examples
           - code: |
               salt '*' grains.ls
               salt '*' grains.items
               salt -G 'os:CentOS' test.ping
           - class_notes: |
               1. The first 2 command line examples list out the minion grains.
               2. You can target based on grains using the '-G' flag via command line.

           - h2: State example
           - code: |
               'role:web':
                   - match: grain
                   - webserver
               'role:database':
                   - match: grain
                   - database

           - h2: 'Lab: View and Set Grains'
           - ul:
            - List and view available grains
            - set a custom grain of role to your minions
           - class_notes: |
               2. salt \* grains.items; salt \* grans.append role web

           - h2: 'Lab: Using Grains in States'
           - p: 'Targeting based on OS grain information.'
           - ul:
             - in your install apache state. set a jinja variable to the correct package name, using an if statement based on the os Grain.
             - use that variable in the install apache state to install the correct package depending on OS
           - class_notes: |
               1. In this lab you will actually want them to go into there previously created state and setup a jinja if statement where if grain['os'] == ubuntu then apache2, etc.

           - code: |
               {% if grain['os'] == 'Ubuntu' %}
               {% set apache_package == 'apache2' %}
               {% elseif grain['os'] == 'CentOS' %}
               {% set apache_package == 'httpd' %}
               {% endif %}

               install_apache:
                 pkg.installed:
                   - name: {{ apache_package }}

           - h2: Pillar
           - p: 'Designed to offer global variables to minions'
           - ul:
             - Managed like Salt State Tree
             - /srv/pillar
             - Storing sensitive data
           - class_notes: |
               1. Pillar provides a way to share data with all minions.
               2. Pillar top file and state files stored in /srv/pillar.
               3. Unlike state tree, pillar data is only available for the targeted minion specified by the matcher type. This makes it useful for storing sensitive data specific to a particular minion.

           - h2: Examples
           - code: |
               salt '*' pillar.items
               salt -P 'key:value' test.ping
           - code: |
               {{ pillar['key'] }}
           - class_notes: |
               1. List out pillar items.
               2. You can target base on pillar with the '-P' flag.
               3. You reference pillar items in state file using '{{ pillar['key'] }}' and the value of key will be dropped in.

           - h2: 'Lab: Using Pillar'
           - p: 'Set pillar data based on OS grain and use that pillar data in the state created in the previous lab instead of the grain.'
           - ul:
             - set up your pillar top file to target based on the os grain and use differnt pillar sls files for each OS
             - Set the correct apache package name to a variable in the respective OS's pillar file
           - class_notes: |
               1. Lab will have them set pillar data targeted by os grain, and use that pillar data in the state instead of the previous grain if statement.

           - p: /srv/pillar/top.sls

                 'os:Ubuntu':
                   - match: grain
                   - Ubuntu

                 'os:CentOS':
                   - match: grain
                   - CentOS
