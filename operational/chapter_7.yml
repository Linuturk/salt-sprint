               1. We are gonna start fully utilizing the power of config management now
               2. Gonna learn how to customize files for our use. Good use is with config files.

               1. These are the components of the file module that we are gonna focus on.
               2. There are many more that you can discover using the docs

               1. Speak to each part of this example.
               2. Point out setting the name of the file and that the source can be a remote lcation aswell.
               3. mention setting permissions

               2. speak to each component
               3. talk about the mkdirs will create the full path if any directories does not exist

           - h2: Game of Chowns!
           - h2: Lab
           - ul:
             - Create a state that will create a directory in the thatch users home directory called saltstuff
             - Create a file on your master that you want to ship to the minions
             - create a state that will ship the file you just created to the saltstuff directory that you created
           - class_notes: |
               1. an example of what this looks like follows
               2 Speak to an excellent use case for something like this would be shipping ssh public keys to all minions.

                   - makedirs: True
           - class_notes: |
               1. this is the answer to the previous lab.
               2. point out that this accomplishes two steps in one as the mkdirs will create the directory as well.
               3. Show that we can set the permissions for the created directory and the created file seperately

               1. We are going to start wielding configuration amangement now
               2. Prepare yourselves for some templating magic

         -
           - h2: Use a template
           - code: |
               ship_salt_stuff_file:
                 file.managed:
                   - name: /home/thatch/saltstuff/saltfile.txt.jinja
                   - source: salt://files/saltfile.txt.jinja
                   - user: thatch
                   - group: thatch
                   - mode: '0755'
                   - makedirs: True
                   - template: jinja
                   - defaults:
                       users_list:
                         - fred
                         - wilma
                         - pebbles
                         - bambam
           - class_notes: |
               1. This is where we explain that you can template a file
               2. show that you set what template style that is
               3. show how your passing in variables via defaults
               4. Point out that naming the files .jinja make it more readable
               5. Point out the unique spacing requirements of defaults (4 spaces instead of 2)

         -
           - h2: Jinja in the index.html
           - code: |
               {% for user in users_list %}
               {{ user }}</br>
               {% endfor %}
           - class_notes: |
               1. SHow quick example of what would be in the index file.
               2. mention white space control in jinja
               3. point out the difference between {{ and {%
               4. {% is for logic (if, for, set)
               5. {{ is for calling variables

         -
           - h2: Files With Defaults Lab
           - ul:
             - Create a state that will ship an index.html file to /var/www/html on the minions.
             - Modify your state so that the index.html is templated.
             - Pass it variables via defaults, make the variables a list of users.
             - fred, wilma, pebbles, bambam.
             - in the index.html file have it list out those users, exept for the user bambam.
           - class_notes: |
               1. Refference previous slides for how this should look
               2. Next slide will be a cliff note

         -
           - h2: Cliff notes state
           - code: |
               ship_salt_stuff_file:
                 file.managed:
                   - name: /var/www/html/index.html.jinja
                   - source: salt://files/index.html.jinja
                   - user: thatch
                   - group: thatch
                   - mode: '0755'
                   - makedirs: True
                   - template: jinja
                   - defaults:
                       users_list:
                         - fred
                         - wilma
                         - pebbles
                         - bambam
           - class_notes: |
               1. mention the ability to use recurse to recusively set permissions in a directory

         -
           - h2: cliff notes index
           - code: |
               {% for user in users_list %}
               {% if user == 'bambam' %}
               {% else %}
               {{ user }}</br>
               {% endif %}
               {% endfor %}

         -
           - h2: But who wants to set variables in every state?
           - p: Variables can use many different sources
           - ul:
             - grains
             - pillar
             - jinja

         -
           - h2: Grains
           - p: You can access grains in your template by the {{ grains }} variable substitution
           - code: |
               {{ grains['os'] }}
               {{ grains.get('os', default) }}
               {{ salt['grains.get']('os', default ) }}
           - class_notes: |
               1. Talk to the ability to access grains dirctly just like you would a jinja variable
               2. First two examples work like a python dictonary.
               3. Third example calls the grains.get salt fuction, and is a best practice!

         -
           - h2: Pillar
           - p: You can access pillar data the same way!
           - code: |
               {{ pillar['users_list'] }}
           - p: You could have done this in the index.html if you had a pillar value set
           - code: |
               {% for user in pillar['users_list'] %}
               {% if user == 'bambam' %}
               {% else %}
               {{ user }}</br>
               {% endif %}
               {% endfor %}
           - class_notes: |
               1. Show them that accessing pillar data is just as easy
               2. show them how they can use these variables directly in the file without the need to set defaults in the state
               3. Pillar data is rendered on the master.
               4. Minion specific data should go in grains!

         -
           - h2: All together now!
           - ul:
             - In pillar create a list of users that only Ubuntu minions will share
             - In pillar create a different list of users that only CentOS minions will share
             - Use that list of users in your templated index.html
             - Also have your index.html display its OS
           - class_notes: |
               They should have the top file in pillar point to seperate users list based on OS grain.
               They should also have in there templates the jinja loop based on pillar data with the os grain listed.

         -
           - h2: Cliff notes
           - p: /srv/pillar/top.sls
           - code: |
               base:
                 'os:{{ grains['os'] }}':
                   - match: grain
                   - {{ grains['os'] }}
           - p: /srv/pillar/Ubuntu.sls
           - code: |
               users_list:
                 - fred
                 - wilma
                 - pebbles
                 - bambam
